# Browser Automation Experiments

A growing collection of browser automation experiments using tools like [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/). These scripts are designed to test, analyze and interact with websites automatically, thus helping improve performance, accessibility and reliability.

## Goals

- Explore automated testing and auditing for websites

- Learn how to programmatically simulate real-world user behavior

- Analyze performance and accessibility data

- Experiment with browser automation tools for personal and professional use

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:devbret/browser-automation-experiments.git
cd browser-automation-experiments
```

2. Choose a tool directory and follow the README.md inside that folder to install dependencies and run the script(s).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** for running automation scripts

- **Puppeteer** for headless browser control

- **Lighthouse** for web performance and SEO auditing

- **axe-core** for accessibility testing

## Contributions

This is a personal learning and exploration project. Pull requests and suggestions are welcome, especially for new testing ideas, automation tools or best practices.
